## 📖 What Is This?

EREBUS--ALP-NEURAL-KINETIC-Non-Equilibrium-Universal-Radiation- is a software tool designed to simulate complex interactions between photons, leptons, and axion-like particles (ALPs) in the cosmos. It helps researchers accurately solve equations that describe how these particles behave in non-equilibrium conditions.

In simple terms, EREBUS models how light and certain particles moved and changed in the early universe. This information helps scientists study dark matter, cosmic radiation, and particle physics.

You do not need any special training to try this software. This guide walks you through each step needed to download and run it on your computer.
